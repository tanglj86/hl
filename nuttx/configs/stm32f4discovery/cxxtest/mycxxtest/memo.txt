Undefined reference to _impure_ptr
----------------------------------
Problem: When building uClibc++ I encounter an undefined reference to
_impure_ptr like:

  LD: nuttx
  .../arm-none-eabi/lib/armv7e-m\libsupc++.a(vterminate.o): In function
  `__gnu_cxx::__verbose_terminate_handler()':
  vterminate.cc:(.text._ZN9__gnu_cxx27__verbose_terminate_handlerEv+0xfc):
  undefined reference to `_impure_ptr'

Solution: No good solution is known. The following works, however:

Locate Get the directory where you can find libsupc++:

  arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -print-file-name=libsupc++.a

Go to that directory and save a copy of vterminate.o (in case you want to
restore it later):

  cd <the-directory-containing-libsupc++.a>
  arm-none-eabi-ar.exe -x libsupc++.a vterminate.o

Then remove vterminate.o from the library. At build time, the uClibc++
package will provide a usable replacement vterminate.o.

  arm-none-eabi-ar.exe -d libsupc++.a vterminate.o

Now NuttX should link with no problem. If you want to restore the
vterminate.o that you removed from libsupc++, you can do that with:

  arm-none-eabi-ar.exe rcs libsupc++.a vterminate.o
